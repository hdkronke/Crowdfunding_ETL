# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

Here is the repository for Project 2 by Bruce Ly and Hays Kronke!

"ETL_Mini_Project_BLy.ipynb" and "ETL_Mini_Project_HKronke.ipynb" pull data from the resources folder to create the four CSV files for the assignment (which are also stored in the resources folder). 

"crowdfunding_db_schema.sql" is used to fulfill the last sengment of the project, creating the crowdfunding database.

Cheers!
