# Crowdfunding Analysis Project
## Postgres SQL and JSON
### This project was a collaboration between Hays Kronke and Bruce Ly

The field we chose to study was crowdfunding and how different factors play into a campaign's success or failure.

First, we needed to map out how the tables were going to store the data and how the primary and foreign keys would relate to each other.

To best optimize our time, we created several filters to organize the data and make it more presentable.

The impact of social media, spotlight status, and project categories was incredibly interesting to see. Success was sometimes determined before a campaign even began!
